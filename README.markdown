# \#GuestCurator

This bot was commissioned by [Curator@mastodon.art][curator] to automate
the re-boosting of another user's boosts over a length of time. The curator first
vets the selected user's boosts and faves the ones they wish to re-boost, then
one toot will be boosted every 25 to 40 minutes.

The bot is entirely controlled by DMing oneself. It was my first attempt at giving a
bot a friendly UI and I think I did OK for a first try ðŸ˜Š Here is [a video of it in action][v].
